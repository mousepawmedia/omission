            In today&apos;s age of texting and social media, we pride ourselves on our
            ability to &apos;read typos&apos;. Our eyes have adapted to overlook misspellings
            and missing letters. In today&apos;s age of texting and social media, we pride
            ourselves on our ability to &apos;read typos&apos;. Our eyes have adapted to
            overlook misspellings and missing letters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Omission challenges you to put your language detective skills to the
            test with a deceptively simple challenge: Find the missing letter! A
            famous quotation will be displayed, with all the instances of a single
            letter removed.
        </p>
        <p>
            How fast can you figure out the missing letter? It&apos;s a race to beat the
            clock (unless you choose another mode) as you try to complete as many
            passages as you can. The faster you answer, the more points you gain.
        </p>
        <p>
            But don&apos;t let your guard down! Omission is designed to conceal any
            evidence of the missing letter, and that&apos;s enough to sometimes stump
            even the professional writers who designed it!
