      In today's age of texting and social media, we pride ourselves on our
      ability to 'read typos'. Our eyes have adapted to overlook misspellings
      and missing letters. In today's age of texting and social media, we pride

      Omission challenges you to put your language detective skills to the
      test with a deceptively simple challenge: Find the missing letter! A
      famous quotation will be displayed, with all the instances of a single
      letter removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      How fast can you figure out the missing letter? It's a race to beat the
      clock (unless you choose another mode) as you try to complete as many
      passages as you can. The faster you answer, the more points you gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But don't let your guard down! Omission is designed to conceal any
      evidence of the missing letter, and that's enough to sometimes stump
      even the professional writers who designed it!
