# Omission

A game where you find what letter has been removed from a passage.

## Content Notes

The content for this game has been derived from "Bartlett's Familiar Quotations".

For brevity, the source of each quote has been omitted - both title and author.

Sections previously italicized have been replaced with CAPS for easier
display.

Passages have been trimmed and rearranged to be no more than 4-5 lines.
